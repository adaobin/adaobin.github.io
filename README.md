# Adaobi Nwankwo's Webpage

This is a page where I'll share some information and the work I am doing in Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on penguins, and I've done some work with Lemurs.

## Work with Penguins

I started learning how to use R by working with Pamlmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://adaobin.github.io/BiostatisticsAnalysis/PenguinAnalysis.html)

## Work with Lemurs
This project is similar to the Penguins dataset but it is a lot larger including about 41,305 Lemurs. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://adaobin.github.io/BiostatisticsAnalysis/Lemurs.html)

## Replication Origin Work
This project involves an intorduction to some bioinformatics work. Here we will be working with a random set of nucleotides. Within this project, I've based my research on a randomly generated genome. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://adaobin.github.io/agmath/BIO4ST1_Group2/Replication_Adaobi_Nwankwo.html)
