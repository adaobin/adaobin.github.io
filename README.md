# Adaobi Nwankwo's Webpage
This is a page where I'll share some information and the work I am doing in Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on penguins, and I've done some work with Lemurs.

## About me
Hello, my name is Adaobi Nwankwo

I am a junior at SNHU majoring in Biology.

While at SNHU, I’ve had the opportunity to gain experience in the biology, microbiology, biochemistry and chemistry lab. I’ve also gained experience in communication skills and leadership skills.

Some of my strengths include perseverance and responsibility. Some of my interests include traveling and visiting new places. I spend any of my extra time serving at a restaurant in Hudson, called T-bones. I'm also a liscenced nursing assistant at an assisted living facility in Bedford. 

Freshamn year I was an online student due to COVID-19 and spent most of my extra time working. The COVID-19 journey was a hard one but allowed me to become very independent and confident in my ability to adjust in a changing environment. 

I’m excited to learn more about what you have to offer.

Here is a link to my resume [here] [Resume Final.docx](https://github.com/adaobin/adaobin.github.io/files/11052777/Resume.Final.docx)


### Work with Penguins

I started learning how to use R by working with Pamlmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://adaobin.github.io/BiostatisticsAnalysis/PenguinAnalysis.html)

### Work with Lemurs
This project is similar to the Penguins dataset but it is a lot larger including about 41,305 Lemurs. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://adaobin.github.io/BiostatisticsAnalysis/Lemurs.html)

### Replication Origin Work
This project involves an intorduction to some bioinformatics work. Here we will be working with a random set of nucleotides. Within this project, I've based my research on a randomly generated genome. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://adaobin.github.io/TheThreeMusketeers/Replication_Adaobi_Nwankwo.html)
