# Adaobi Nwankwo's Webpage

This is a page where I'll share some information and the work I am doing in Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on penguins, and I've done some work with Lemurs.

## Work with Penguins

I started learning how to use R by working with Pamlmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://github.com/adaobin/BiostatisticsAnalysis/PenguinAnalysis.html).
